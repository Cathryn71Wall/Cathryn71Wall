## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub! Iâ€™m an AI enthusiast exploring the possibilities of language models through hands-on projects built with OpenAI and LangChain. This repository is a reflection of my curiosity, learning, and experimentation at the intersection of artificial intelligence and real-world applications.

My work focuses on leveraging large language models to build intelligent, context-aware systems that can reason, respond, and assist in meaningful ways. Using OpenAIâ€™s powerful APIs, Iâ€™ve been creating tools and prototypes that showcase how language models can enhance productivity, automate tasks, and create interactive experiences.

In parallel, Iâ€™m learning how to use LangChain to build more advanced, modular applications that chain together prompts, tools, memory, and external data sources. LangChain has opened up exciting possibilities for building agents, chatbots, and data-driven AI applications with greater flexibility and control.

This repository includes a variety of projectsâ€”from simple prompt engineering examples to more complex AI workflows involving memory, retrieval, and tool usage. Whether it's a chatbot that pulls live data, a code assistant, or a research summarizer, each project represents a step forward in understanding how to build with language models effectively.

As I continue to explore, Iâ€™m focused on writing clean, well-documented code and experimenting with techniques that improve prompt quality, context management, and user interaction. Iâ€™m also beginning to explore areas like embeddings, vector databases, and agent-based architectures.

If youâ€™re interested in AI development, prompt engineering, or building with OpenAI and LangChain, feel free to explore the code, give feedback, or collaborate on a project. Iâ€™m always excited to learn from others and share ideas.

Thanks for stopping byâ€”and hereâ€™s to building smarter applications, one token at a time.
